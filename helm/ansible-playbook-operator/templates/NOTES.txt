Thank you for installing ansible-playbook-operator.

This chart installs the operator deployment and RBAC permissions.
CRDs are delivered under crds/ and should be installed/upgraded with the chart.

RBAC Configuration:
- Preset: {{ .Values.rbac.preset }}
  - minimal: Least-privilege namespaced permissions (recommended for single-namespace deployments)
  - scoped: Cross-namespace access for cluster-wide scenarios
  - cluster-admin: Full cluster permissions (use with caution, only when playbooks need cluster-wide access)

The operator is now running and ready to manage Ansible playbook executions.
