## Phase 3: Enhanced Execution Capabilities
- [ ] **Advanced Execution Modes**: Parallel playbook execution with dependency graphs, playbook composition (pre/post hooks), conditional execution based on external factors, and execution templates for common patterns.
- [ ] **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter, circuit breaker patterns for failing hosts, smart retry based on failure types (network vs. playbook errors), and retry policies per playbook section.
- [ ] **Resource Management**: Dynamic resource allocation based on playbook complexity, resource pooling for concurrent executions, and predictive scaling based on execution patterns.
- [ ] **Execution Analytics**: Execution time profiling, bottleneck identification, optimization suggestions, and performance regression detection.

## Phase 4: Dedicated Run Management (v1beta1+)
- [ ] **Run CRD Design**: Introduce `Run` CRD for ad-hoc executions with full lifecycle management, execution history, and status tracking. Replace annotation-based manual runs.
- [ ] **Run Templates**: Predefined run configurations for common scenarios, parameterized run templates, and run composition for complex workflows.
- [ ] **Run Scheduling**: Advanced scheduling options (calendar-based, event-driven, cron with exclusions), run queuing and prioritization, and run dependency management.
- [ ] **Run Analytics**: Run success/failure trends, performance baselines, cost tracking, and automated optimization recommendations.

## Phase 5: Enhanced Observability and Monitoring
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for end-to-end execution tracing, correlation IDs across operator components, and trace-based debugging capabilities.
- [ ] **Advanced Metrics**: Custom metrics for business logic (playbook categories, execution contexts), predictive alerting based on historical patterns, and integration with external monitoring systems.
- [ ] **Real-time Dashboards**: Live execution monitoring, interactive playbook debugging, and visual execution flow representation.
- [ ] **Alerting Integration**: Webhook-based notifications, PagerDuty/ServiceNow integrations, customizable alert rules, and escalation policies.

## Phase 6: Integration and Webhook Capabilities
- [ ] **Webhook System**: HTTP webhooks for execution events, webhook signature verification, and retry policies for failed deliveries.
- [ ] **External System Integration**: REST API clients for external systems, OAuth/OIDC integration for external services, and plugin architecture for custom integrations.
- [ ] **Event Streaming**: Event sourcing for audit trails, Apache Kafka/Redis Streams integration, and real-time event processing pipelines.
- [ ] **API Gateway**: REST/GraphQL API for external integrations, rate limiting, authentication/authorization, and API versioning.

## Phase 7: Advanced Security Features
- [ ] **Enhanced RBAC**: Attribute-based access control (ABAC), policy engines (OPA Gatekeeper), and dynamic permission management.
- [ ] **Secret Management Integration**: External secret store integration (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), secret rotation automation, and encryption key management.
- [ ] **Network Security**: Service mesh integration (Istio/Linkerd), mTLS for internal communication, and advanced network policies.
- [ ] **Compliance Features**: Audit logging with tamper-proof storage, compliance reporting (SOC2, PCI-DSS), and automated compliance checks.

## Phase 8: Multi-Tenancy and Federation
- [ ] **Workspace Management**: Multi-tenant workspace isolation, resource quotas per workspace, and cross-workspace resource sharing.
- [ ] **Federation Support**: Multi-cluster playbook execution, cluster selection strategies, and federated status aggregation.
- [ ] **Tenant Management**: Tenant onboarding/offboarding automation, tenant-specific configurations, and billing integration.
- [ ] **Cross-Cluster Operations**: Global playbook execution, cluster failover strategies, and distributed state management.

## Phase 9: Advanced Scheduling Features
- [ ] **Calendar Integration**: Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook), business day calculations, and holiday-aware scheduling.
- [ ] **Event-Driven Scheduling**: File change triggers, external API event triggers, and Kubernetes event-based scheduling.
- [ ] **Advanced Cron Features**: Cron with time zones, cron expressions with exclusions, and dynamic schedule modification.
- [ ] **Schedule Optimization**: Schedule deduplication, resource-aware scheduling, and automated schedule optimization.

## Phase 10: Machine Learning and Intelligence
- [ ] **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based failure prediction, performance forecasting, and automated optimization suggestions.
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**: Execution pattern analysis, outlier detection, and automated incident response.
- [ ] **Smart Defaults**: AI-powered configuration recommendations, playbook optimization suggestions, and automated best practice enforcement.
- [ ] **Natural Language Processing**: Playbook documentation analysis, automated tagging, and conversational debugging interfaces.

## Phase 11: Developer Experience Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced CLI Tool**: Standalone CLI for local development, CRD generation from existing playbooks, and interactive playbook debugging.
- [ ] **IDE Integration**: VS Code extension for playbook development, IntelliJ plugin for enhanced development experience, and browser-based playbook editor.
- [ ] **Testing Tools**: Playbook testing framework, mock server for external dependencies, and automated test generation from playbooks.
- [ ] **Documentation Enhancement**: Interactive tutorials, video guides, and community-contributed example library.

## Phase 12: Performance and Scalability
- [ ] **Horizontal Scaling**: Operator sharding, distributed work queues, and load balancing across operator instances.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Execution result caching, lazy loading of large repositories, and optimized resource usage patterns.
- [ ] **Database Integration**: External metadata storage (PostgreSQL, etcd), query optimization, and backup/restore capabilities.
- [ ] **Edge Computing**: Edge execution capabilities, CDN integration for large files, and geographically distributed execution.

## Migration and Compatibility (v1beta1+)
