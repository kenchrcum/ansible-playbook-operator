# TODO Discipline (Agent Workflow)

- Always reconcile the TODO list before starting new work:
  - Mark newly completed tasks as completed immediately after finishing.
  - Keep only one task `in_progress` at a time.
  - Set the next task to `in_progress` before starting it.
  - Cancel skipped tasks with a one-line justification.

- Gate before edits: reconcile TODOs, then proceed with file or code edits.

- After each meaningful step (file created, endpoint added, build/test run), update the corresponding TODO item status right away.

- When all goal tasks are done:
  - Check off any remaining items, reconcile, and close the TODO list.
  - Mark tasks as completed in `architecture/TODO.md` with `[x]` format.
  - Provide a brief, high-signal summary of changes (no process narration).
  - Run pre-commit checks and ensure all tests pass before marking complete.
  - **Commit all changes** with descriptive conventional commit message.

- Do not leave stale TODOs; the list must reflect current reality at all times.
