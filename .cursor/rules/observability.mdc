# Observability

- **Kubernetes Events**: Emit Kubernetes Events on meaningful state changes of custom resources.
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Expose Prometheus metrics for reconciles, queue depth, and job results. A Service and optional ServiceMonitor should be provided.
- **Structured Logging**:
  - Use structured JSON logs.
  - Include correlation IDs, such as the Custom Resource UID and a unique run ID.
  - **Do not log secrets.**
