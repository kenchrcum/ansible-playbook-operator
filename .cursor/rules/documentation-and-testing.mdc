# Documentation and Testing

## Testing
- Use `pytest` for all tests.
- Prefer unit tests for business logic.
- Use kind-based integration tests for controllers.
- CI must pass linting, type-checking, unit tests, and an integration smoke test.
- Every Pull Request must update tests and documentation as needed.

## Documentation
- Keep `architecture/development-plan.md` as a living design document. Update it before implementing significant changes.
- Examples in the `examples/` directory must be runnable in `kind` or `minikube` and follow security defaults.

## Quality Gates
- New features must include metrics, events, and status conditions.
- Reject changes that introduce secret leakage or reduce security defaults.
