# Python Development Guidelines

## Language & Tooling
- Use Python 3.11.
- Lint with `ruff`.
- Format with `black`.
- Type-check with `mypy`.

## Code Style
- Use strict typing at public boundaries. Avoid `Any` in public APIs.
- Use descriptive names; avoid abbreviations. Prefer clarity over brevity.
- Use guard clauses instead of deep nesting.
- Handle errors explicitly; never swallow exceptions.
- Keep functions small and focused. Extract pure functions for testability.
- For test files: use proper type annotations for variables (e.g., `status: dict[str, Any] = {}`).

## Commit Hygiene
- No commented-out code.
- No `TODO`s left in the code; implement them or create an issue.
