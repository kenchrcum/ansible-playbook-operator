# Agent Workflow Expectations

## Commit Requirements
- **Always commit changes** when completing tasks or making meaningful progress
- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Include detailed commit body for significant features or changes
- Reference completed TODO items when appropriate
- Run pre-commit checks before committing: `source .venv/bin/activate && pre-commit run --all-files`

## Task Completion Workflow
1. Implement the requested changes
2. Update relevant tests and documentation
3. Run tests and pre-commit checks
4. Update TODO list with completed items
5. **Commit all changes** with descriptive message
6. Provide brief summary of what was accomplished

## Commit Message Examples
- `feat: add comprehensive Ansible execution options to Playbook CRD`
- `fix: remove invalid metadata properties from Repository CRD`
- `docs: update Cursor Rules with Ansible execution capabilities`
- `test: add unit tests for new CLI options and execution capabilities`

## Progress Tracking
- Use TODO lists to track work progress
- Mark tasks as `completed` when finished
- Update `architecture/TODO.md` with `[x]` format
- Don't leave work uncommitted at session end

## Quality Standards
- All code changes must pass pre-commit checks
- Tests must pass before committing
- Follow project coding standards and conventions
- Include appropriate documentation updates
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Session Completion
- Commit all changes before ending session
- Provide clear summary of accomplishments
- Ensure TODO list reflects current state
- Leave repository in clean, committable state
