# Git Workflow

## Branch Naming
- `feat/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `docs/*`: Documentation changes
- `chore/*`: Build process, dependency updates, etc.
- `refactor/*`: Code refactoring without changing external behavior
- `test/*`: Adding or improving tests

## Commits
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Squash merge Pull Requests.
- Commits should be small and focused.
- Commit messages should be meaningful and emphasize the "why" of the change.
- The body of a PR description should also contain a short "why".
