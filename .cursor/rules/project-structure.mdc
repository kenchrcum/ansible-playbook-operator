# Project Structure

- `src/` contains controller entrypoints and services.
  - `controllers/`: Kubernetes controller logic.
  - `services/git/`: Git service.
  - `services/ansible/`: Ansible service.
  - `k8s/resources/`: Kubernetes resource definitions.
- `schemas/` for CRDs and JSON schemas. These are not templated in Helm.
- `helm/` for the Helm chart.
  - `helm/ansible-playbook-operator/crds/`: CRDs are stored here.
  - `helm/ansible-playbook-operator/templates/`: Helm templates.
- `tests/` is split into `unit/` and `integration/`.
- `examples/` contains minimal, secure-by-default manifests.
- Key architectural decisions are in [architecture/development-plan.md](mdc:architecture/development-plan.md).
